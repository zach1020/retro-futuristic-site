_Ah, computers! Such intelligent creatures…_

Going into the new year, and I mean really _going into it_ with that strange January cocktail of ambition, mild panic, and an overactive sense of possibility, I realized I wanted to revamp my personal portfolio website for 2026. Not refresh it. Not “iterate” on it. Revamp it in the biblical sense. Burn it down conceptually and rebuild something that actually sounded like me when it spoke.

The old site wasn’t wrong, exactly. It just wasn’t telling the whole truth anymore. It functioned. It was legible. It behaved. But it felt like it was introducing me the way a LinkedIn headline introduces a human being: technically accurate, emotionally vacant. And once I noticed that disconnect, I couldn’t unsee it. A personal site that doesn’t reflect how you think is worse than no site at all. It’s a polite lie.

So I rebuilt it. Conceptually first, obsessively second, and yes—_vibe coded_ the implementation. The result is zachbohl.com. Everything on it is my brainchild. The ideas, the tone, the aesthetic posture, the pacing, the deliberate friction, the moments of playfulness that threaten to undermine seriousness but never quite do. That’s all me. The code is the instrument. I’m the composer.  

And before we go any further, I should also say this plainly, because honesty is sort of the throughline here: **I used ChatGPT to help write this blog post too.** That wasn’t an accident, and it wasn’t laziness. It was consistency. This entire project is about authorship as direction, not martyrdom through manual execution. I know what I want to say. I know how I want it to sound. ChatGPT helps me tune the signal. I still decide when it’s right.

That same philosophy applied to the site itself. Vibe coding, as I practice it, is not abdication of thought. It’s the opposite. It requires you to be _more_ opinionated, not less. When the friction of implementation drops, the only thing left to judge is the quality of the idea. You can’t hide behind effort anymore. Either the thing has a soul, or it doesn’t.

Before anything was built, I knew how I wanted the site to feel. That part took hours. Actual hours of concentrated calibration. Not coding hours—thinking hours. Sitting there adjusting tone in my head. Deciding how confident is too confident, how playful is too playful, how much technicality signals competence without tipping into performative cleverness. That’s the work people don’t see, because it doesn’t leave fingerprints. But it’s the part that matters most.

Aesthetically, I landed on retro-futurism, but not the lazy, neon-synthwave caricature of it. I wanted something closer to optimism-with-edges. A future imagined by people who still believed computers might help us become more interesting, not just more optimized. Chunky interfaces. Bold typography. Motion that feels intentional instead of ornamental. A site that looks like it has opinions and isn’t afraid to express them.

I’ll say this openly: **I drew inspiration from poolsuite.net.** Not in a copy-paste sense, but in the way that good art reminds you what’s possible. Poolsuite understands something fundamental about software and joy, about interfaces that feel alive instead of purely transactional. That gave me permission to lean into personality instead of sanding it down.

Structurally, the site is not optimized for skimming. That’s deliberate. It’s paced. It asks you to linger. I wanted the experience of moving through it to mirror how I approach problems: slowly enough to notice details, fast enough not to bore myself. There are no purely decorative choices. Even the moments of friction are part of the conversation.  

One of my favorite features—and I say this with zero irony—is the **sun and moon cycle that changes based on your system time**. That little detail gives me an unreasonable amount of joy. It’s subtle, but it makes the site feel aware of the world it lives in. Morning feels different from night. Interfaces should acknowledge time. Computers are temporal creatures, after all.

Another feature I love, even though it’s still very much a work in progress, is the **community paint area**. The idea that people can come together and collectively use something like MS Paint on my website scratches a very specific itch in my brain. It’s playful, a little chaotic, and deeply internet-native. It’s not done yet, but that’s okay. I like that it’s becoming rather than finished. So am I.

The music on the site is original, and that’s important to me. None of it is AI-generated. I care a lot about creative authorship, even when I’m happy to use tools to assist execution. Music, especially, still feels like a place where human intention should remain unmistakable. The site sounds like me because it is me, in that sense too.

All of this, incidentally, is happening while I am fully aware that I “should” be studying cybersecurity certifications. That thought hovers over most of my creative work like a benevolent but judgmental ghost. But I’ve learned not to fight that tension. The urge to build expressive systems and the discipline required to secure them are not opposites. They’re part of the same mind. One feeds the other, whether I like it or not.  

There’s been a lot of anxious discourse lately about authorship in the age of AI, about whether something “counts” if you didn’t personally grind through every mechanical step. I think that anxiety misses the point. Authorship has always been about intent, taste, and responsibility. This site reflects my intent. It reflects my taste. It reflects my willingness to say, publicly, this is how I think right now.

The theme of this entire project was captured accidentally in something I once posted on X while waiting for Antigravity to do my bidding:  

> **“Ah, computers! Such intelligent creatures…”**

I meant it half-jokingly at the time, but it’s grown into something more sincere. Computers are strange collaborators. They amplify us. They expose us. They reflect our thinking back at us, sometimes uncomfortably clearly.

This website is a conversation with those creatures. A record of how I’m thinking as we head into 2026. It’s not final. It’s not precious. But after hours of calibration, iteration, rejection, and refinement, I can say this with confidence: **I’m really pleased with the outcome.**

The plumbing is modern. The tools are powerful. The thinking is mine. And for now, at least, it feels honest.
