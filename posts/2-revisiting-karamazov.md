Ten years ago, at the age of 20, I cracked open one of the finest works of literature humanity has ever produced. Did I understand it? Will I understand it now?

*The Brothers Karamazov* by Fyodor Dostoevsky is a beast. 900 pages of Russian philosophy wrestling with faith, evil, family, and murder. I remember sitting in a diner at 1 AM reading Ivan's conversation with the devil. The dread was palpable.

Did I get it then? I'm not sure. I've always "struggled with faith." I've dabbled in other traditions like Hinduism, but it never quite clicked. 

This isn't about fishing for faith; it's a retrospective. I don't remember much of the plot, but I remember the feeling. Back in my late teens, I was a Dostoevsky fan before it was a cliché. Now at 30, after a bumpy ten years, I'm wondering what else the book has to say.

Life threw some wild stuff at me—heartbreaking and hilarious. A retrospective at 30 might seem gauche, but I just want to make cool shit for my bros. 

So, what are you reading? Me? I'm reading Dostoevsky. Again.
